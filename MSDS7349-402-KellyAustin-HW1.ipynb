    "## Exercise 1: UNIX Password Cracker\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to write a password cracker for the UNIX file system. UNIX stores all passwords in the file/etc/passwd. Well, it doesn’t store the password itself. Instead, it stores a signature of the password by using the passwordto encrypt a block of zero bits prepended by a salt value with a one-way function called crypt( ). \n",
    "    \n",
    "   The result of the crypt() function is stored in the /etc/passwd file. For example, for a password of “egg” and salt equal to “HX”, the function crypt(‘egg’,‘HX’) returns HX9LLTdc/jiDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When you try to log in, the program /bin/login takes the password that you  typed, uses crypt( ) to encrypt a block of zero bits, and compares the result of this function with the value stored in the /etc/passwd file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The security of this approach rests on both the strength of the crypt( ) function and the difficulty in guessing a user’s password. The crypt( ) algorithm has proven to be highly resistant to attacks. Conversely, the user’s choices for passwords have been found to be relatively easy to guess, with many passwords being words contained in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   To write our UNIX password cracker, we will need to use the crypt( ) algorithm that hashes UNIX passwords. Fortunately, the crypt library already exists in the Python standard library. To calculate the encrypted UNIX password signature, we simply call the function crypt.cypt( ) and pass it the password and salt as parameters. This function returns the signature as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   A simple dictionary attack involves computing the possible signatures generated for each word in the dictionary with a range of salt values."
